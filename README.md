## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

- TikTok
    - The personalized algorithm is really great for curating content and making using the app really engaging.
    - The feature for speeding up videos is nice because sometimes people speak too slow

- Reminders
    - I like being able to create recurring events, which is great for assignments
    - The view where you can see your lists and scheduled events is good for a hollistic view of your tasks
    - The ability to add descriptions or labels to individual tasks

- Schedules (AC Transit App)
    - You can see all the bus lines and stops from this, so if you are familier with the bus lines you can easily access real timings and locations of the buses
    - Favorting the lines you use the most often
    - Automatic tracking of the stops near you

**App Idea**

I want to make an app targetting towards the curly hair community. Over the last few years, I have learned a lot about how to take care of my hair, but the journey required a lot of trial and error. A centralized platform that can make finding products easier, tracking your routine, and engaging with others would be great for paving the path for the curly haired community. 

There are three main features this app will have. 
1) Extensive Tagging System: Curly hair products will be searchable on the platform. Not only will all products have their usual descriotion, they will also be tagged for their different usecases (for low-porosity hair, meant for thinner hair, etc) so that users can find products for their niche needs. 
2) Hair Routines: The app will also let people create "hair routines" where they can add products to a sequence to showcase their hair routine and then also take notes. This will be great when trying out new hair routines, tracking their effect, and comparing them to older routines. 
3) Community Aspect: There will also be a community aspect where people can ask questions in the forum, make blog posts, and comment on individual products. People with similar struggles and successes will be able to learn from each other!

## Notes

The features I implemented are:
- Adding labels
- Button to randomy change the background color
- One Button to randomy change the color of the label texts

The biggest challenge was figuring out how to instantiate the labels so that I could change the color of the text. After some googling and looking at forums, I figured out how to create a variable for the labels, and then used the same function for the backgrounder changer.
